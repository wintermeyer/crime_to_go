# CrimeToGo - Implementation Summary

## Overview
CrimeToGo is a multiplayer online detective game built with Phoenix LiveView and Elixir. Players collaborate to solve crimes through real-time communication and evidence analysis.

## Implemented Features

### ✅ Database Schema & Migrations
- **Games** table with UUID, game codes (12 digits, no 0,1,7), states (pre_game, active, post_game)
- **Players** table with nickname, avatar constraints, game host designation
- **Chat Rooms** table supporting public and private rooms
- **Chat Messages** table with soft-deletion support
- **Chat Room Members** table for private room membership

### ✅ Context Modules (Business Logic)
- **Game Context** (`CrimeToGo.Game`)
  - Create/update/delete games
  - Unique game code generation
  - Game state management (pre_game → active → post_game)
  - Player relationship management

- **Player Context** (`CrimeToGo.Player`)
  - Player creation with nickname/avatar uniqueness per game
  - Game host management
  - Human vs robot player filtering
  - Availability checking for nicknames and avatars

- **Chat Context** (`CrimeToGo.Chat`)
  - Public/private chat room management
  - Message creation with soft-deletion
  - Room membership management
  - Message history with deleted message filtering

### ✅ Web Interface (LiveView)
- **Home Page** (`/`) 
  - Modern, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
  - Create new game functionality
  - Join existing game with validation
  - Dark mode support
  - Mobile-first responsive layout

- **Player Join Page** (`/games/:id/join`)
  - Player registration form
  - Nickname input with validation
  - Avatar selection modal
  - Unique constraint validation
  - First player becomes game host
  - Automatic public chat room membership

### ✅ Data Validation & Constraints
- Game codes: 12 digits, excluding 0, 1, and 7
- Unique game codes across all games
- Unique nicknames per game (max 140 chars)
- Unique avatar filenames per game (max 255 chars)
- Unique chat room names per game (max 100 chars)
- Chat message content limit (max 1000 chars)
- Proper foreign key relationships with cascading deletes

### ✅ Test Coverage
- **83 comprehensive tests** covering all major functionality
- Context module tests for Game, Player, and Chat
- LiveView integration tests for Home and Join pages
- Validation tests for all constraints
- Edge case testing (duplicates, invalid data, etc.)
- Soft deletion testing for chat messages

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Phoenix Framework 1.8** - Web application framework
- **Elixir** - Functional programming language
- **Ecto** - Database ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Phoenix LiveView** - Real-time server-rendered UI

### Frontend
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework  
- **Phoenix LiveView** - Server-side rendering with real-time updates
- **Alpine.js** - Lightweight JavaScript framework for interactions
- **Heroicons** - Icon library

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database
- **UUID primary keys** - For all tables
- **Proper indexing** - On foreign keys and unique constraints
- **Cascading deletes** - To maintain referential integrity

## Code Quality
- ✅ All tests passing (83 tests, 0 failures)
- ✅ Code formatted with `mix format`
- ✅ Proper Elixir conventions followed
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation with @doc blocks
- ✅ Type specifications and validation
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases covered

## Future Development Ready
The implemented foundation supports:
- Real-time chat functionality (PubSub channels defined)
- Game lobby system (routes defined)
- Evidence and clue management (extensible schema)
- Player session management
- Game state transitions
- Notification system
